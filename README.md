Mod/Hack/Cheat That turns Bot Games into "MM" games with separate inventory, level and ranks by intercepting GC communication.

Current Features:
- Getting service medal
- Getting xp from matches
- Saving/Load progress

Notes:
- The mod is in very early stage right now, its very unstable and not gameplay ready.
- The service medal claiming doesn't work like in csgo, skips the entire menu of claiming and just gives it to player.
